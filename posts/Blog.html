              <h2>Java Applet</h2>
              <p>
                Java applets are pretty old school now and not widely used
                anymore because modern web technology like html, css, js has
                taken over, but backen in those days , appplets in java were
                used as a key tool for creative a interactive web projects
              </p>

              <h3> sample code</h3>
              <p>
                <details>
                  <summary>click to view code</summary>
                <code>
                  import java.applet.Applet;<br>
                  import javat.awt.Graphics;<br><br>
                  public class HelloWordApplet extends Applet{<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;public void paint(Graphics g){<br>
                      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;g.drawString("Hello world", 20, 20)<br>
                  &nbsp;  }<br>
                  }
                </code>
                </details>
                <h3>What's the process ?</h3>
                <ol type="1">
                  <li><b>java.applet.Applet</b> is the base cass for creating applet,
                    and the <b>java.awt.Graphics</b> is the class that provides context for drawing on the applet
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    we created the  class <b>HelloWordApplet</b> class which extends the Applet class
                  </li>
                  <li>paint method is used to drawing purposes</li>
                  <li>Graphics class drawstring is used to draw string on cooridanate (20,20)</li>

                </ol><br>

                in order to run this applet , we hvae to create html and link it thee using applet tag like this <br>
                <details>
                  <summary>click to view code</summary>
                  <code>
                    &lt;applet code = "HelloWordApplet"&gt;<br>
                    &lt;/applet&gt;
                  </code>
                </details>
              </p>
              this create a simple canvas like design that displays string hellow world.

              <h3>How to run?</h3>
              <p>just compile the java code and openup that html where u used the applet,keep in note, ue interent explorer like no chromium browers  to see changes as other chromimum based brower aint be supporting it </p>
            </div>
          </li>

          <!-- #CORS -->
          <li id="p2">
            <div>
              <h2>CORS</h2>
              <p>
               CORS [Cross Origin REsources Sharing], is like a secutiy guard for a web browser
               which decides wheather a web page can request resources from a diff domain than one it came from 
               it basically allows servers who can access their resources and how, this helps prevent security issues like data theft,
               or unauthorized access
              </p>
              <h3>How to enable CORS?</h3>
              <p>
                lets take a custum python backend framework, flask, thier is 
                <code>flask-cors</code> package which u can install via
                <code> pip install flask-cors</code>
                <details>
                  <summary>backend code </summary>
                  <code>
                    from flask import Flask<br>
                    from flask_cors import CORS<br>
                    <br>
                    app = Flask(__name__)<br>
                    CORS(app)<br>
                    <br>
                    @app.route('/')<br>
                    def hello_world():<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;return 'hello, cors!'<br>
                   <br>
                    if __name__ == '__main__'<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;app.run(debug=True)
                </code>
                <br><br>            
                <small>this enables CORS for all routes</small>                
              </details> 
            </p>
            <h3>accessing in frontweb</h3>
            <p>
              make sure u have Axios installed or install it via 
              <code>nom install axios</code> which helps to make route requests to backend server<br><br>
              so lets say u have it installe dnad in a react exmaple.tsx, u create a component to send req, which should look like this while sending request
              <details>
                <summary>VIEW CODE</summary>
                <code>axios.get('api route for server')<br>
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;.then(reposnse => {
                    <br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp; //whatever logic u want it
                    <br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>
                    )

          <!-- How a fishing attack is performed -->
          <li id="p3">
            <div>
              <h2>What is Phising attack ?</h2>
              <p>
                A Phising attack is a cybercrime which tries to steal your personal information
                 by pretending to be someone you trust, solely focusing on tricking peoples 
                 into giving thier sensetive information like passwords, credit details and others
              </p>
              <h3>How is it performed?</h3>
              <p>generally Phising attack means to replicate same
                structure but in a malicious factor, their are various way, hackers devlop their 
                own code forms  and send to thier victims, or their are various tools available like z-phisher,
            

                <ul>
                  <li>
                    first of all a usual hacker or any scammer develops thier own looking social login form or replica or use pre built tools like <a href="https://github.com/htr-tech/zphisher">Z-Phisher</a>
                  </li>
                  <li>they host their masked malicious site to any other platform and they would have pre bult databse connected to it, so basically whatevyer u enter thinking it real site, eveything is kept tracked and logged
                   by the attacker
                  </li>
                </ul>
              <br>
              <div>
                here is the stepwise procedure how they pullit off:
     <ol type="1">
      <li>
        This is the interfact of <b>zphisher</b>,showcasing all the credential forms it replcates:
        <br>
        <img src="../assets/phish_awarness/dash.png" alt="z-phisher dashboard">
      </li>
      <li>
        suppose an attacker targets a user to steal its facebook credentials, in this sceneratio the attacker would generate a corresponding login form , in this case its 1;
        <br>
        <img src="../assets/phish_awarness/networktunnels.png" alt="tunnels">
        <br>
      various hosting options are provided such as local enviroment, exposing locales to ineternet and others, lets assume attacker choses local for now 
      </li>
      <li>once the attacker opts to run the phising page locally, the tool displays port which it being hosted on <br>
        <img src="../assets/phish_awarness/hostedlocal.png" alt="local running">
      </li>
      <li>
the attacker can now share the live phising page link with target , sinceits exact copy of real page, victim wont notice anything, upon visiting, victim ip is captures as defualt;
<br>
<img src="../assets/phish_awarness/facebookreplicalive.png" alt="facebook page replicated">
      </li>
      <li>
        believing the page to be legit, the victim enter his credential details and after victim enters login, evey data will be forwareded to attacker database
        <br>

     </ol>
     <h3>How to get aware of this?</h3>
     <ol type="i">
      <li>verify URLS</li>
      <li>Avoid clicks</li>
      <li>Secure connections</li>
      <li>educate yourself</li>
      <li>use mfa layers on your social site</li>
