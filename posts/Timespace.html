            <b>SAMAN</b> is a MERN ecosystem project built with MongoDB, Express,
            React, and Node.js. MongoDB manages scalable,dynamic data storage,
            while Express and Node.js handle backend API requests and
            serverside logic. React powers the frontend for an interactive,
            responsive user interface. The project is optimized for performance
            and scalability.

              I was looking for some project scroling googles and taking sugests from every sources, what shud i be making for my MERN stack.
              then i came across this ecommerce building idea.
            </li>
            <li>after finalizing the idea, i went to many reference material and outdated youtube videos, however form youtube, i managed to get some little little concept of a how ecomerce website is really built</li>
            <li>i designed its architecture, data flow and diagrams</li>
            <li>i created various databse models, for users products and other and created various middlewares and routes controllers at backend</li>
            <li>i bootstraped my front end in react and creatied various routing methodolgy , nested privated and public routes</li>
            <li>using api calls from front end i managed to connnect the front end to backedn and make my project working locally on every part</li>
            <li>prblem was with the hosting , but i somehow managed to get free plan of one onth frot hosting my backedn in render with all the .env variables connected nd pointing to backedn datas and bases</li>
            <li>front end hosting was easy hosted, via typical vercel poiting the .env backedn bariable to render url</li>

             <ol type="1">
              <li>i worked upon flask a python web based framework to bult various web application, 
                and i wanted a project and yea i came up with a project which mainly focus on a grpahic based tool to generate a 
                image which can be connnected  platforms like profiling system.
              </li>
              <li>
                this is generally considered as backend only project but i designed this in such a way it is available as a visually for webs
              </li>
              <li>
                after i bult this application in flask , i needed to host, and i think vercel is best for this things ,tho its temporary yet still works, and i chose to host it in there
